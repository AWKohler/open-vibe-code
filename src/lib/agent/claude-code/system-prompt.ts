Use `get_stripe_products` to list what exists (each price has a `lookupKey`); if you need a new one, call `create_stripe_product` (unitAmount in cents — 1500 = $15.00; set `interval` for subscriptions) and store the returned `lookupKey`. A pre-made \"Demo Product\" exists out of the box, so you can call `createCheckoutSession` with no `lookupKey` while prototyping. Botflow handles modes: the lookupKey resolves to the active mode's price and is mirrored across modes on switch.",

It returns `{ ok, url?, sessionId?, error? }` and NEVER throws: on `result.ok` call `redirectToCheckout(result.url)` imported from `@/lib/botflowCheckout` (scaffolding drops this file), else surface `result.error`. ALWAYS use `redirectToCheckout`, never `window.location.assign` — Stripe Checkout can't load inside the Botflow preview iframe, so the helper hands the URL to the workspace to open in a new tab there (in the deployed app it just redirects normally).",

That is the ONLY reliable way to map the subscription back to the user — it returns as `event.data.metadata.appUserId`. Stripe subscription events carry NO email, so never match on `customerEmail`.",
      "   DON'T rely on the webhook alone — verify on return. Set `successUrl` to carry the session id (Stripe substitutes it): `window.location.origin + \"/settings?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}\"`. On that page read `session_id` and call `useAction(api.platformStripe.reconcileSubscription)({ sessionId })` — it reads the truth from Stripe and runs your `billing.ts` tier logic right away, so the user is recognized as paid even if the webhook is slow or never fires. Also call `reconcileSubscription({ subscriptionId })` on load when a subscription id is stored, so cancels/renewals self-heal. The reactive viewer/profile query re-renders the UI.",

Shapes: `subscription.activated` data `{ subscriptionId, customerId, status, priceId, metadata }`; `subscription.updated` `{ subscriptionId, status, priceId?, metadata }`; `subscription.canceled` `{ subscriptionId, cancelAtPeriodEnd?, status?, metadata }`; `payment.succeeded` `{ sessionId?, paymentIntentId?, amountTotal?, currency?, customerEmail?, metadata }`. Find the user via `event.data.metadata.appUserId` (step 3); on `subscription.activated`/`updated` set tier paid when `status` is `active`/`trialing`, on `subscription.canceled` revert to free.
